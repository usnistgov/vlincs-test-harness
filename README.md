 vlincs-test-harness

The Video LINCS program aims to develop re-identification methods that autonomously associate objects across diverse, non-collaborative, video sensor footage, to distill raw pixel data into spatio-temporal motion vectors, providing the ability to analyze these patterns for anomalies and threats.

This code is used to execute and evaluate submissions to this program.
